# Currency Conversion Application

Welcome to the Currency Conversion Application repository! This Compose Multiplatform currency conversion application is built upon the principles of a clean MVVM architecture. The application leverages the Restful webservice provided by [exchangeratesapi.io](http://api.exchangeratesapi.io).

## Key Features:

- **Compose Multiplatform:** The application utilizes the power of Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose for building a consistent UI across platforms.
- **Koin:** Dependency injection is handled by Koin, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Sql Delight:** Database operations are streamlined with Sql Delight, providing a seamless and type-safe database interaction.
- **Ktor:** Network requests are managed by Ktor, enabling efficient and asynchronous communication with the API.
- **Moko (Mvvm and Flow):** Moko libraries are employed for implementing the MVVM architecture and handling data flow within the application.
- **KotlinX Coroutines:** Asynchronous programming is achieved using Kotlin coroutines, ensuring a responsive user experience.

## Architecture:

The application follows a clean architecture with the following layers:

- **Data:** Manages data access, including network and database operations.
- **Domain:** Contains the business logic and domain-specific entities.
- **Presentation:** Handles UI-related logic and interacts with the ViewModel.
